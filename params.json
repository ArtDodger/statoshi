If you’re running Linux, it’s probably easier to install via your package manager.\r\n\r\n4) Install software to visualize the stats collected by StatsD. We recommend [Graphite](http://graphite.wikidot.com/installation). Make sure you install a version newer than 0.9.12 for [maximum Grafana performance.](http://grafana.org/docs/performance/)\r\nFor Graphite, once you have it installed you’ll want to configure how it stores the data from StatsD, in the graphite/conf/storage-schemas.conf:\r\n\r\n    [carbon]\r\n    pattern = ^carbon\\.\r\n    retentions = 60:90d\r\n    \r\n    [stats]\r\n    priority = 110\r\n    pattern = ^stats\\..*\r\n    retentions = 10:2160,60:10080,600:262974\r\n5) Download (or git clone) the Statoshi fork:\r\n```\r\n    jameson@lopp:~/workspace/$ git clone https://github.com/jlopp/statoshi.git\r\n    Cloning into ‘statoshi’…\r\n    remote: Reusing existing pack: 35655, done.\r\n    remote: Total 35655 (delta 0), reused 0 (delta 0)\r\n    Receiving objects: 100% (35655/35655), 26.56 MiB | 2.37 MiB/s, done.\r\n    Resolving deltas: 100% (25766/25766), done.\r\n    Checking connectivity… done\r\n```\r\n\r\n6) Compile the project. This can be a bit tricky if it's your first time due to the dependencies; you'll likely want to read the documentation:\r\n* Linux build notes are [here](https://github.com/jlopp/statoshi/blob/master/doc/build-unix.md)\r\n* OSX build notes are [here](https://github.com/jlopp/statoshi/blob/master/doc/build-osx.md)\r\n* Windows build notes are [here](https://github.com/jlopp/statoshi/blob/master/doc/build-msw.md)\r\n\r\nOnce you think you have all of the dependencies installed, build the project. For Linux, the commands are:\r\n```\r\n    jameson@lopp:~/$ cd /path/to/statoshi/\r\n    jameson@lopp:~/workspace/statoshi/$ ./autogen.sh\r\n    jameson@lopp:~/workspace/statoshi/$ ./configure\r\n    jameson@lopp:~/workspace/statoshi/$ make\r\n```\r\n\r\nIt may take 20+ minutes to build, depending upon the speed of your computer. If you’re missing a dependency, you should receive an error noting what is missing.\r\n\r\nNote that the Statoshi project assumes that you are running StatsD on the same machine as your Bitcoin Node. If you wish to run StatsD on a different machine or non-default port, you’ll need to edit the default configuration on line 16 of **/statoshi/src/statsd_client.h** before building the project.\r\n\r\n7) Start your Statoshi node (either the GUI or the command line daemon) - the Linux commands for them are:\r\n```\r\n    GUI: /path/to/statoshi/src/qt/bitcoin-qt &\r\n    Daemon: /path/to/statoshi/src/bitcoind &\r\n```\r\nNow you can check out the stats as they roll in to Graphite; you should see graphs begin to be populated within 30 seconds!","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
