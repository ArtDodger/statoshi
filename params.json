If you’re running Linux, it’s probably easier to install via your package manager.\r\n\r\n5) Install software to visualize the stats collected by StatsD. We recommend [Graphite](http://graphite.wikidot.com/installation). Make sure you install a version newer than 0.9.12 for [maximum Grafana performance.](http://grafana.org/docs/performance/)\r\nFor Graphite, once you have it installed you’ll want to configure how it stores the data from StatsD, in the graphite/conf/storage-schemas.conf:\r\n\r\n    [carbon]\r\n    pattern = ^carbon\\.\r\n    retentions = 10:2160,60:10080,600:262974\r\n    \r\n    [stats]\r\n    priority = 110\r\n    pattern = ^stats\\..*\r\n    retentions = 10:2160,60:10080,600:262974\r\n    \r\n    [default]\r\n    pattern = .*\r\n    retentions = 10:2160,60:10080,600:262974\r\n\r\nTo prevent loss of sparse data you'll also need to modify Graphite's graphite/conf/storage-aggregation.conf:\r\n\r\n    [min]\r\n    pattern = \\.min$\r\n    xFilesFactor = 0.0\r\n    aggregationMethod = min\r\n    \r\n    [max]\r\n    pattern = \\.max$\r\n    xFilesFactor = 0.0\r\n    aggregationMethod = max\r\n    \r\n    [sum]\r\n    pattern = \\.count$\r\n    xFilesFactor = 0.0\r\n    aggregationMethod = sum\r\n    \r\n    [default_average]\r\n    pattern = .*\r\n    xFilesFactor = 0.0\r\n    aggregationMethod = average\r\n\r\n6) Download (or git clone) the Statoshi fork:\r\n```\r\n    jameson@lopp:~/workspace/$ git clone https://github.com/jlopp/statoshi.git\r\n    Cloning into ‘statoshi’…\r\n    remote: Reusing existing pack: 35655, done.\r\n    remote: Total 35655 (delta 0), reused 0 (delta 0)\r\n    Receiving objects: 100% (35655/35655), 26.56 MiB | 2.37 MiB/s, done.\r\n    Resolving deltas: 100% (25766/25766), done.\r\n    Checking connectivity… done\r\n```\r\n\r\n7) Compile the project. This can be a bit tricky if it's your first time due to the dependencies; you'll likely want to read the documentation:\r\n* Linux build notes are [here](https://github.com/jlopp/statoshi/blob/master/doc/build-unix.md)\r\n* OSX build notes are [here](https://github.com/jlopp/statoshi/blob/master/doc/build-osx.md)\r\n* Windows build notes are [here](https://github.com/jlopp/statoshi/blob/master/doc/build-msw.md)\r\n\r\nOnce you think you have all of the dependencies installed, build the project. For Linux, the commands are:\r\n```\r\n    jameson@lopp:~/$ cd /path/to/statoshi/\r\n    jameson@lopp:~/workspace/statoshi/$ ./autogen.sh\r\n    jameson@lopp:~/workspace/statoshi/$ ./configure\r\n    jameson@lopp:~/workspace/statoshi/$ make\r\n```\r\n\r\nIt may take 20+ minutes to build, depending upon the speed of your computer. If you’re missing a dependency, you should receive an error noting what is missing.\r\n\r\nNote that the Statoshi project assumes that you are running StatsD on the same machine as your Bitcoin node. If you wish to run StatsD on a different machine or non-default port, you’ll need to edit the default configuration on line 16 of **/statoshi/src/statsd_client.h** before building the project.\r\n\r\n8) Set some values in your bitcoin.conf file; the 'gettxoutsetinfo' command ensures that UTXO metrics get populated after each new block arrives. Note that you probably don't want to set the blocknotify command until your node is synced to the chain tip, otherwise it will slow down the node's syncing.\r\n```\r\nrpcuser=unguessableUser3256\r\nrpcpassword=someRandomPasswordWithEntropyHere\r\nblocknotify=sleep 30 && /path/to/statoshi/src/bitcoin-cli gettxoutsetinfo\r\n```\r\n\r\n9) Start your Statoshi node (either the GUI or the command line daemon) - the Linux commands for them are:\r\n```\r\n    GUI: /path/to/statoshi/src/qt/bitcoin-qt &\r\n    Daemon: /path/to/statoshi/src/bitcoind &\r\n```\r\nNow you can check out the stats as they roll in to Graphite; you should see graphs begin to be populated within 30 seconds!\r\n\r\n10) If you wish to duplicate the UI on [statoshi.info](http://statoshi.info), you'll also need to install Grafana. You can find [installation instructions here](http://docs.grafana.org/installation/).\r\n\r\nAt a minimum, you'll want /opt/grafana/config.js to contain:\r\n```\r\n      datasources: {\r\n        graphite: {\r\n          type: 'graphite',\r\n          url: \"http://yourserver:8080\",\r\n        },\r\n      },\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe default dashboard file is located at /opt/grafana/dashboard/file/default.json - you can load the main dashboard from [statoshi.info](http://statoshi.info) by clicking on the 'save' icon in the upper right of statoshi.info and selecting \"Dashboard JSON.\" Overwrite the contents of default.json with this payload.\r\n\r\nOptionally, you may also wish to [install Elasticsearch](https://www.elastic.co/downloads/elasticsearch) in order to support saving and loading custom dashboards. In this case you should then add it to the \"datasources\" in config.js:\r\n```\r\n        elasticsearch: {\r\n          type: 'elasticsearch',\r\n          url: \"http://yourserver:9200\",\r\n          index: 'grafana-dash',\r\n          grafanaDB: true,\r\n        }\r\n```","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
