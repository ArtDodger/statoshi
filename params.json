I recommend Graphite: http://graphite.wikidot.com/installation\r\n\r\nDownload and build the Bitcoin Statoshi fork:\r\n```\r\njameson@lopp:~/workspace/$ git clone https://github.com/jlopp/statoshi.git\r\nCloning into ‘statoshi’…\r\nremote: Reusing existing pack: 35655, done.\r\nremote: Total 35655 (delta 0), reused 0 (delta 0)\r\nReceiving objects: 100% (35655/35655), 26.56 MiB | 2.37 MiB/s, done.\r\nResolving deltas: 100% (25766/25766), done.\r\nChecking connectivity… done\r\n```\r\n\r\nNow you need to make sure you have the dependencies required to build Bitcoin Core. \r\n\r\nLinux build notes: are [listed here](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/master/doc/build-unix.md)\r\n\r\nOSX build notes: are [listed here](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/master/doc/build-osx.md)\r\n\r\nWindows build notes: are [listed here](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/master/doc/build-msw.md)\r\n\r\nOnce you think you have all of the dependencies installed, build the project.\r\n\r\n```\r\njameson@lopp:~/$ cd /path/to/statoshi/\r\njameson@lopp:~/workspace/bitcoin/$ ./autogen.sh\r\njameson@lopp:~/workspace/bitcoin/$ ./configure\r\njameson@lopp:~/workspace/bitcoin/$ make\r\n```\r\nIt may take 20+ minutes to build, depending upon your computer’s specs. If you’re missing a dependency, you should receive an error noting what is missing.\r\n\r\nNote that the Statoshi project assumes that you are running StatsD on the same machine as the Bitcoin Node. If you wish to run StatsD on a different machine or non-default port, you’ll need to edit the default configuration on line 16 of /statoshi/src/statsd_client.h before building the project.\r\n\r\nStart your Statoshi node (either the GUI or the command line daemon)\r\n```\r\n/path/to/bitcoin-metrics/src/qt/bitcoin-qt &\r\n/path/to/bitcoin-metrics/src/bitcoind &\r\n```\r\n\r\nNow you can check out the stats as they roll in to Graphite; you should see graphs begin to be populated within 30 seconds!","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
